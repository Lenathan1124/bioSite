            <h1>10 questions</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Flashback to when you were ten years old.  What do you want to be when you grow up?</li>
                <br/>
                Growing up, I did not think much about what I wanted to be. It was because I enjoyed playing basketball all throughout my high school days that I thought I found something I could be passionate about. During my freshman year and senior year of high school, I tore my ACL, which resulted in surgery and going to physical therapy for about nine months time. Being around physical therapists who helped rehabilitate me to play basketball again was an exposure that helped me decide on what I thought I could be. <br/>
                <br/>
                <li>If you changed your career path midway through college, what made you realize that you wanted to change?</li>
                <br/>
                It was during my second year of college that I changed my major and chose a different career path. I realized that I did not want to major in kinesiology with the intention of becoming a physical therapist because I finally acknowledged the amount of school and education that would be required of me. Also, I became less passionate about rehabilitation and the idea that I would do that for the rest of my life. I changed to nursing because I wanted something that was quick to put me in the workforce while helping people and making decent money. After working for about a year, I was encouraged by doctors, who later became my mentors, to obtain my nurse practitioner. During the process of obtaining my master's degree in psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner, I became more fond of the idea of being a mid-level provider because I believed I would have a more impactful role in patient care. Over time I became more happy with my change and still am. <br/>
                <br/>
                <li>What professional accomplishment are you most proud of, and how did you achieve it?</li>
                <br/>
                One of my professional accomplishments include obtaining a charge nurse position just a few months after starting my job. I achieved this by exhibiting helpfulness and leadership skills. I am most proud of this because it has shown me that I am not just making an impression on patients that I care fore, but being resourceful and helpful to colleagues and others around me. <br/>
                <br/>
                <li>What helped motivate you to strive for your career?</li>
                <br/>
                My greatest motivation for striving for this career is witnessing, quite often, people struggling with mental health and lacking the support because of the mental health stigma. Whether it be cultural or societal factors, support seems to always be warranted. <br/>
                <br/>
                <li>How do you think your colleagues/ coworkers would describe you?</li>
                <br/>
                I think my colleagues would describe me as helpful, knowledgeable, a team player, supportive, and strong.<br/>
                <br/>
                <li>What would be your personal motto?</li>
                <br/>
                My personal motto would be to do your best and do whats right so you could never go wrong. <br/>
                <br/>
                <li>What are you passionate about?</li>
                <br/>
                I am most passionate about doing what is ethically and morally right, caring for others, and prioritizing family.<br/>
                <br/>
                <li>What skills and talents do you have to offer others?</li>
                <br/>
                The skills and talents I have to offer others is my knowledge, supportive skills, and genuine care. I have great communication and team working skills contributing to a supportive environment. <br/>
                <br/>
                <li>What makes your job so unique?</li>
                <br/>
                My job is so unique because it is not like the typical healthcare someone would envision. For instance, being a psychiatric health care provider, the number one treatment is not necessarily a medication. Often times being a listening ear, providing a supportive and safe environment, or offering solutions and guidance may outweigh the need for medications and procedures for healing and maintaining health.<br/>
                <br/>
                <li>Looking back at your career path, is there anything you would change?</li>
                <br/>
                Looking back at my career path, there is nothing I would change because I think every sacrifice or hardship that I endured has made me who I am today. I am not regretful nor do I wish to have done anything differently because I am happy with who I have become thus far.
